# Photogram---Instagram-clone-

This is a Instagram clone I built with ruby on rails to revise what I've learnt in rails development.  

Special thanks to devwalks for his brilliant guide. 

Which can be found here: https://www.devwalks.com/lets-build-instagram-in-rails-part-1/

Features I plan on adding include:

User features 
- users will be able to follow other users and see their posts and comment on their posts
- users will be able to be followed by other users and see comments on their posts.
